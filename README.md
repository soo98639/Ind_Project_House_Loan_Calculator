# House Loan Calculator

## Introduction

Due to COVID-19, the rate of fixed deposit had faced a huge decrement in the year of 2020. Therefore, people are looking for another low-risk investment which has a higher rate of income on investment. The property investment is being one of the risk-free investments. It is one of the investments that most suitable for the ignorant investor. Therefore, the people prefer to invest in property instead of other risky or low-return investment. As my observation, most of the buyer are lack of knowledge in calculating the monthly payment of housing loan. Then, some of them might need to consult property agent or bank staff. Also, the property agent or bank staff need time to calculate the monthly payment. Furthermore, it will take more time if the buyer wants to know about the balance on a specific year. Moreover, it is also hard to avoid the human careless mistake in manual calculation.

To make this process more effective and efficient, I decided to develop a House Loan Payment Calculator. By inserting the property price, down payment, loan period and interest rate, House Loan Payment Calculator shall calculate the monthly payment should be paid by the buyer. In addition, it will also display the principal, interest, and balance of every year during the loan period. The user of the system is buyer, bank staff and property agent.

n = Total number of payments (loan period x 12)
